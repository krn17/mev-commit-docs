Submitting Bids

## Introduction

Once you've allocated the necessary funds to your bidder node's wallet, you're ready to start submitting bids to the network.
It's crucial to verify that your bidder node is connected to at least one provider node.
This connectivity can be confirmed via the [localhost:13523/topology](http://localhost:13523/topology) endpoint.

### üí≥ PrePay For Bids

Before diving in, make sure you've topped up your bid account. Run this command to preload your account with enough credits to start bidding:

```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/prepay/1000000000000000000
```

This tops up your account with `1000000000000000000 wei` (1 ETH), ensuring you're all set to send out those bids!

## REST API

The REST API provides a straightforward way to submit bids using HTTP requests.
Refer to the API documentation for detailed usage instructions.

üöÄ **Ready to send bids?** Just execute this command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash ‚ùØ_ structure
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
  "txHash": <the hash of the transaction>,
  "amount": <amount in wei>,
  "blockNumber": <blocknumber>
}'
```

```bash ‚ùØ_ example
curl -X POST http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid \
-d '{
  "txHash": "91a89B633194c0D86C539A1A5B14DCCacfD47094",
  "amount": 10000000000000000,
  "blockNumber": 4123456
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

üåê **Postman Power**: Prefer a GUI? We've created a
[custom Postman request](https://primev.postman.co/workspace/Team-Workspace~18870d84-94f0-4d1e-8163-db558f83d7e8/request/27192304-fab87a71-9722-46f8-825f-d9791ead6178?ctx=documentation&tab=body)
as an alterative way to send bids. Ensure you've got the Postman agent ready to go!

## Official Go RPC Client

For Go developers, leveraging the official Go RPC client is the recommended approach. Start by installing the mev-commit package:

```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
go get github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit
```

Then, incorporate the generated client into your Go application as follows:

```go go
import bidderapiv1 "github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/gen/go/rpc/bidderapi/v1"

conn, err := grpc.DialContext(
    context.Background(),
    "localhost:13524",
    grpc.WithBlock(),
    grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()),
)

if err != nil {
    // Error handling logic here
}

bid := &pb.Bid{
    TxHashes: []string{
        "fe4cb47db3630551beedfbd02a71ecc69fd59758e2ba699606e2d5c74284ffa7",
        "71c1348f2d7ff7e814f9c3617983703435ea7446de420aeac488bf1de35737e8",
    },
    Amount:      "1000000000", // Specify amount in wei
    BlockNumber: 123456,
}

rcv, err := bidderClient.SendBid(context.Background(), bid)
if err != nil {
    // Error handling logic here
}

for {
    pc, err := rcv.Recv()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    }
    if err != nil {
        // Error handling logic here
    }
    fmt.Println("Received preconfirmation:", pc.String())
}
```

### Command-Line Tools

For those who prefer to use command-line tools, options like [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl), or [BloomRPC](https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc) are available.
These tools require the protobuf definitions from the repository to interact with the RPC services.

### Custom Client Generation

Utilize the provided protobuf files to generate a client in your preferred programming language, enabling seamless integration with your existing codebase.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, developers can efficiently submit bids to the network,
ensuring participation in the bidding process with their desired configurations and preferences.
