## Receiving your First Preconfirmation

### Step 1. Get a mev-commit Bidder Node up and running

```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -o launchmevcommit <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/main/launchmevcommit> \
&& chmod +x launchmevcommit \
&& ./launchmevcommit --node-type bidder
```

This will fund your wallet, and start a new mev-commit bidder node for you.

If you‚Äôve already ran the command, it will ask you if you want to overwrite. Respond with a `y` for a clean setup.

There is a mev-commit provider node on the Holesky testnet that will always instantly commit to a bid and return a preconfirmation.
However, this provider will not be able to deliver inclusion as it's a "dummy" provider.

### Step 2. Submit Bid and receive Preconfirmation commitment

Change the `txHash` `amount` and `blockNumber` to your liking

```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST <http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid> \
-d '{
  "txHash": "91a89B633194c0D86C539A1A5B14DCCacfD47094",
  "amount": 20000,
  "blockNumber": 899099
}'
```

üéâ Congrats, you received your first L1 preconfirmation!
