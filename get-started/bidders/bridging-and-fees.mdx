## Bridging quick-start 

Bridging currently requires the use of a bridge cli tool. A frontend compatible with wallet integrations will be available soon.

To test out the bridge cli with a one-liner using a pre-funded account on Holesky, try the following command:

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/v0.1.0/bridge.sh | bash
```
Otherwise see further instructions to bridge using your own Holesky account.

First build the user cli for your machine from this directory:

```shell
make user_cli
```

Or use a pre-built binary from the `releases` tab in [mev-commit-bridge](https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit-bridge/releases).

Set proper environment variables for a cross-chain transfer, example below:

```shell
export PRIVATE_KEY="0xe82a054e06f89598485134b4f2ce8a612ce7f7f7e14e650f9f20b30efddd0e57"
export LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export L1_RPC_URL="https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com"
export SETTLEMENT_RPC_URL="https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz"
export L1_CHAIN_ID="17000"
export SETTLEMENT_CHAIN_ID="17864"
export L1_CONTRACT_ADDR="0xceff0a364f63f621ff6a8b5ce56569ec6f3c6220"
export SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ADDR="0xf60f8e762a3fe90fd4d8c005872b6f6e12eda8ca"
```

Note the above contract addresses are correct for the current deployment of the mev-commit testnet. Constant ENS addresses will be available soon.

To bridge ether from Holesky to the mev-commit chain, use:

```shell
./bin/user_cli bridge-to-settlement --amount $AMOUNT_IN_WEI --dest-addr $DEST_ADDR
```

Where `PRIVATE_KEY` corresponds to an account that's funded on Holesky. 

To bridge ether back to Holesky from the mev-commit chain, use:

```shell
./bin/user_cli bridge-to-l1 --amount $AMOUNT_IN_WEI --dest-addr $DEST_ADDR
```
Where `PRIVATE_KEY` corresponds to an account that's funded on the mev-commit chain.
