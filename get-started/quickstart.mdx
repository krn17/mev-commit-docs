# Quickstart

Ready to get your node up and running? This streamlined process will guide you through launching either a bidder or provider node in the Primev network.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="üì• Download">

    Start by downloading the latest setup script from our repository.

    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    curl -o launchmevcommit \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/main/launchmevcommit
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="üõ†Ô∏è Permission">

    Ensure the script is executable with the following command:

    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    chmod +x launchmevcommit
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="üöÄ Launch">

    Execute the script to initiate your node, selecting either a bidder or provider configuration based on your role in the network.

    <CodeGroup>

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ bidder
        ./launchmevcommit --rpc-url http://69.67.151.95:8545 --node-type bidder
        ```

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ provider
        ./launchmevcommit --rpc-url http://69.67.151.95:8545 --node-type provider
        ```

<Accordion title="ü§î What does the script do?">

    ## Script Overview

    This script automates the setup and initialization of your Primev node, catering to both bidder and provider roles. Below is a detailed breakdown of the script's operations:

    ### 1. Initialization
    - Sets up essential variables like the RPC URL (`http://69.67.151.95:8545`) for network communication and the node type (either `bidder` or `provider`).
    - Establishes the root directory (`$HOME/.mev-commit`) where the mev-commit node will be installed.

    ### 2. Download
    - Fetches the appropriate mev-commit binary for your system from the [Primev GitHub releases page](https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/releases/tag/v0.1.0), considering your operating system and architecture.

    ### 3. Installation
    - Extracts the downloaded binary into the specified root directory, ensuring all necessary executables are correctly placed for the node's operation.

    ### 4. Configuration
    - Initializes the mev-commit node with your specified settings, including the node type and the RPC endpoint, along with necessary contract addresses for the node's functionality.

    ### 5. Wallet Setup
    - Generates a new private key and wallet address for your node and secures it with test ether to facilitate transactions within the testnet environment.

    ### 6. Node Startup
    - Launches the mev-commit node in the background tailored to the specified role, enabling it to begin its operations within the Primev network.

    ### 7. Cleanup
    - Includes a cleanup function to ensure the node is properly shut down when the script exits, preventing any residual processes.

# Manual Setup

Below, you'll find a guide tailored for those who prefer a more customized installation approach.

<Steps titleSize="h3">

  <Step title="Install cast">
  
  We use the [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) CLI tool for making Ethereum RPC calls.
  If it's not already installed on your system, you can set up the entire Foundry toolchain, including `cast`, with the following command:

    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```

    After installation, execute `foundryup` to update to the latest versions of Foundry's suite of tools:
     `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`:


    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    foundryup
    ```

    For detailed guidance, refer to the official [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installation instructions.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check your CPU architecture">

    Run the following command which will identify your OS, and chip architecture:

    ```bash  ‚ùØ_ terminal
    uname -sm
    ```

    This command will output something like `Linux x86_64` or `Darwin arm64`, depending on your system.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the mev-commit binary">

    Navigate to the [mev-commit repo](https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
     and select the mev-commit binary tailored to your system.
    For example, if `uname -sm` yields `Linux x86_64`, opt for `mev-commit_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`.
    Download, then extract the binary into your preferred root directory to continue with setup.

    You can use the following command which automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate
    mev-commit binary for your system into your home directory:

    ```bash  ‚ùØ_ terminal
    FILENAME="mev-commit_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz"
    curl -L "https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/releases/download/v0.1.0/$FILENAME" \
    | tar -xz -C $HOME
    ```

    <Accordion title="üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Recommended: Verify the checksum">

    Before executing any code downloaded from the internet, it's recommended to verify the checksum,
    a practice that ensures the file's integrity and authenticity. Checksums, provided with each release on GitHub,
    serve as a safeguard, allowing you to confirm that the downloaded binary has not been compromised or altered,
    thus protecting your system from potential security risks.

    To verify the checksum of the mev-commit binary, you can follow these simplified steps (assumes binary is the home directory):

    <Steps>

      <Step title="Grab the checksum">

        Set the binary's name based on your system and retrieve the corresponding checksum:

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
        FILENAME="mev-commit_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz"
        CHECKSUM=$(curl -L \
        "https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/releases/download/v0.1.0/mev-commit_0.1.0_checksums.txt" \
        | awk "/$FILENAME/ {print \$1}")
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify">

        Verify the binary's checksum by running the following:

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash linux
        echo "$CHECKSUM $HOME/$FILENAME" | sha256sum -c -
        ```

        ```bash macOs (Darwin)
        echo "$CHECKSUM $HOME/$FILENAME" | shasum -a 256 -c -
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

       ‚úÖ **Success**

        If the output resembles the following, you may confidently proceed to the next steps:

        ```bash
        filename.tar.gz: OK
        ```

        ‚ùå **Failure**

        Should the output indicate a failure, as shown below, re-download the file and attempt verification once more.

        ```bash
        filename.tar.gz: FAILED
        shasum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match
        ```

        If checksum verification continues to fail after multiple attempts, reach out to Primev for support.
      </Step>

    </Steps>

    </Accordion>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize mev-commit">

    Navigate to the directory with the mev-commit binary and execute the initialization command:

      <CodeGroup>

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ bidder
        ./mev-commit init \
        --dir . \
        --rpc-endpoint http://69.67.151.95:8545 \
        --peer-type bidder
        ```

        ```bash ‚ùØ_ provider
        ./mev-commit init \
        --dir . \
        --rpc-endpoint http://69.67.151.95:8545 \
        --peer-type provider
        ```

      </CodeGroup>

    This generates a `private key` and `config.yaml`, saving both in the current directory. To set environment variables for your key, address, and private key, use:

    ```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
    export KEY=$(cat key)
    export ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key 0x$(cat key))
    export PRIVATE_KEY="0x7c9bf0f015874594d321c1c01ada3166c3509bbd91f76f9e4d7380c2df269c55"
    ```

  </Step>
