To register on the mev-commit network, providers need to stake some ether with the provider registry contract. This adds credibility to issued commitments, as the stake may be slashed in the event of a broken commitment, such as committing to a preconfirmation bid and not including the relevant transaction in a block. 

Once a provider is registered on the p2p network, other nodes will connect to it and the provider node should see bids come in.

You can use the provider API to check and add stake.

*   Check stake

    ```bash
    > curl localhost:13523/v1/provider/get_stake | jq
    {
      "amount": "0"
    }
    ```

    In order to stake, first fund the Ethereum account relevant to your provider node on the mev-commit chain.

    *   Get the account address of your node

        ```bash
        > curl localhost:13523/topology | jq
        {
          "self": {
            "Addresses": [
              "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/13522",
              "/ip4/172.29.0.4/tcp/13522"
            ],
            **"Ethereum Address": "0xB9286CB4782E43A202BfD426AbB72c8cb34f886c"**,
            "Peer Type": "provider",
            "Underlay": "16Uiu2HAmDWZb4DxZQkS9yseXNukBFe6MhZdimSKuZcHFeJrF3jC9"
          },
          "connected_peers": null,
          "blocked_peers": null
        }
        ```
    *   Fund your account with ether on the mev-commit chain. Currently for the testnet, you can use a faucet account to get some mev-commit chain ether. This can be done using the cast command:

        ```bash
        > cast send --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz \\
        	--private-key 0x7c9bf0f015874594d321c1c01ada3166c3509bbd91f76f9e4d7380c2df269c55 \\
        	$ADDRESS \\
        	--value 100ether
        ```

        This command will transfer 100 ETH on mev-commit to your `$ADDRESS` which should be enough to get started.

        Alternatively, use the bridge from Holesky to fund your account. See [bridging-and-fees](https://docs.primev.xyz/get-started/bidders/bridging-and-fees).

*   Check the minimum amount that can be staked, and consider staking more than the minimum. Bidders will only connect to providers which have stake higher than this minimum. The larger a provider's stake, the greater the credibility behind that provider's commitments. The amount is set in `wei`.

    ```bash
    > curl localhost:13523/v1/provider/get_min_stake | jq
    {
      "amount": "1000000000000000000"
    }
    ```

*   Stake

    ```bash
    > curl -X POST localhost/v1/provider/register_stake/10000000000000000000 | jq
    {
      "amount": "10000000000000000000"
    }
    ```

Once staked, peer connection logs should appear within a few minutes. You can check the `/topology` endpoint again to verify connected peers.
