In order to register as a provider in the mev-commit network, you have to stake some ETH on the provider registry. This adds credibility to the commitments that you'll be issuing, as the stake may be slashed in the event of breaking a commitment, such as committing to a preconfirmation bid and not including the transaction in a block. Once the provider node is registered on the network, other nodes will connect to it and the provider node should start seeing bids come in.

You can use the provider API to check and add stake.

*   Check the stake

    ```bash
    > curl localhost:13523/v1/provider/get_stake | jq
    {
      "amount": "0"
    }
    ```

    In order to stake, we need to first add funds to the Ethereum wallet created for the node on the mev-commit chain.

    *   Get the wallet address of the node

        ```bash
        > curl localhost:13523/topology | jq
        {
          "self": {
            "Addresses": [
              "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/13522",
              "/ip4/172.29.0.4/tcp/13522"
            ],
            **"Ethereum Address": "0xB9286CB4782E43A202BfD426AbB72c8cb34f886c"**,
            "Peer Type": "provider",
            "Underlay": "16Uiu2HAmDWZb4DxZQkS9yseXNukBFe6MhZdimSKuZcHFeJrF3jC9"
          },
          "connected_peers": null,
          "blocked_peers": null
        }
        ```
    *   Add funds to the account. Currently for the testnet, you can use the Primev account to get some testnet ETH. This can be done using the cast command:

        ```bash
        > cast send --rpc-url <https://rpc.mev-commit-chain.xyz> \
        	--private-key 0x7c9bf0f015874594d321c1c01ada3166c3509bbd91f76f9e4d7380c2df269c55 \
        	$ADDRESS \
        	--value 100ether
        ```

        This command will transfer 100 ETH on mev-commit to your `$ADDRESS` which should be enough to get started.
*   Check the minimum amount that can be staked, and consider staking a multiple of it. Bidders will only connect to providers which have stake higher than this minimum, and the larger your stake, the greater the credibility behind your commitments. The amount is set in `wei`

    ```bash
    > curl localhost:13523/v1/provider/get_min_stake | jq
    {
      "amount": "1000000000000000000"
    }
    ```
*   Stake

    ```bash
    > curl -X POST localhost/v1/provider/register_stake/10000000000000000000 | jq
    {
      "amount": "10000000000000000000"
    }
    ```

Once you have staked, you should seeing peers getting connected in the logs within a few minutes. You can check the `/topology` endpoint again to verify that you have some connected peers.
