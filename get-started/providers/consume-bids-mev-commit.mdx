sidebarTitle: Consuming Bids

Provider nodes that have a stake in the mev-commit registry will start receiving bids on the mev-commit p2p network from bidders. In order to see the incoming bids, the providers need to communicate with the provider API using the RPC clients or the HTTP APIs. 

Once a provider sees a bid and decides to accept or reject it, they send the status to the mev-commit node. If the bid is ACCEPTED, a signed commitment is sent back to the bidder and the mev-commit node will issue a transaction to the mev-commit chain to record the commitment. 

It is the provider's responsibility to deliver inclusion of the transactions once they make a commitment. If they win or influence the mev-boost auction and they include the transactions correctly, the bid rewards will be settled by the oracle and made available to the provider. If the bid is rejected, no commitment is made and no response is sent to the network. There is no reward or penalty for rejecting bids. The accept and reject decisioning logic is left up to the provider.

There are 4 options to communicate with the API

*   We recommend using the official go RPC client to communicate with the mev-commit API. In order to use this in go code, you can go get the mev-commit package and then import the generated client.

    ```go
    import providerapiv1 "[github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/gen/go/rpc/providerapi/v1](<http://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/gen/go/rpc/providerapi/v1>)"

    conn, err = grpc.DialContext(
    			context.Background(),
    			"localhost:13524",
    			grpc.WithBlock(),
    			grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()),
    )

    if err != nil {
    	// handle error
    }

    client := providerapiv1.NewProviderClient(conn)

    bidStream, err := client.ReceiveBids(context.Background(), &providerapiv1.EmptyMessage{})
    if err != nil {
    	// handle error
    }

    bidC := make(chan *providerapiv1.Bid)
    go func() {
    	defer close(bidC)
    	for {
    		bid, err := bidStream.Recv()
    		if err != nil {
    			// handle error
    		}
    		select {
    		case <-bidStream.Context().Done():
    		case bidC <- bid:
    		}
    	}
    }()

    stream, err := client.SendProcessedBids(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
    	// handle error
    }

    for bid := range bidS {
    	// check the bid details and communicate with the block-building
    	// infrastructure to make a decision
    	status := getDecision(bid)

    	err := stream.Send(&providerapiv1.BidResponse{
    			BidDigest: bid.BidDigest,
    			Status:    status,
    	})
    	if err != nil {
    		// handle error
    	}	
    }
    ```

    There is an [example implementation](https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit/tree/main/examples/provideremulator) of a dummy provider client that can be found in the repository which blindly accepts all the bids it sees. This could be a good starting point for providers to use if they are trying to integrate a Golang project in.
* Use [https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) or [https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc](https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc) or other GUI clients like [Postman](https://www.postman.com). The protobuf files are available in the repository.
* Check the [API docs](https://primev-24.mintlify.app/api-reference/provider/sendprocessedbids) to use the REST APIs. The RPC APIs are also available on the HTTP server.
* Users can use the protobuf files to generate client in language of their choice.
