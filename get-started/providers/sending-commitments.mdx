To send your first commitment, you will need to connect to the primev Testnet. 
This will allow you to consume bids incoming to the network and submit commitments. 
Your first step is to set up a provider node. The following command will allow you to automatically set up a full provider mev-commit node:

```
curl -o launchmevcommit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/main/launchmevcommit && chmod +x launchmevcommit && ./launchmevcommit --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz --node-type provider
```

Now you'll want to run an emulator to simulate the accepting and rejecting of bids. You can read more about the internal builder API [here](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/provider/sendprocessedbids).

To get started with the emulator, open a new termainl and run the following command:
<Warning>You require Go Version 1.21.1 to run the example emulator</Warning>
```
git clone https://github.com/primevprotocol/mev-commit.git && cd mev-commit && git checkout v0.2.0 && cd examples/provideremulator && go run .
```

Now you have a running instance of both an emulator that will auto-accept incoming bids and a provider node that will submit commitments on your behalf.
