To send your first commitment quickly, you will need to connect to the primev Testnet.
This will allow you to consume bids incoming to the network and do commitments.

Your first step is to construct a provider node. The following command will allow you to automatically set up a full provider mev-commit node.
```
 curl -o launchmevcommit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/main/launchmevcommit && chmod +x launchmevcommit && ./launchmevcommit --rpc-url https://chainrpc.testnet.mev-commit.xyz --node-type provider
 ```
