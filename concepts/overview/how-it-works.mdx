At the core of MEV-Commit is a sophisticated framework designed to facilitate the exchange of execution bids and commitments between MEV actors, such as searchers and block builders.

This system operates within the mev-commit network, enabling participants to broadcast and receive bids in a real-time environment.
These bids encompass transaction specifics and proposed execution fees, which are disseminated across the network for consideration by execution providers.

Upon evaluating these bids, providers may issue binding commitments to include the transactions in forthcoming blocks, enhancing both the transparency and competitiveness of MEV extraction processes.
This framework not only promotes an equitable transaction execution landscape but also contributes to the overall stability of the blockchain ecosystem.

The architecture of the mev-commit peer-to-peer (P2P) network is designed to support instantaneous communication among network participants:

### Network Connectivity

The network is structured to ensure robust connectivity among users and providers. Each participant node connects to a primary network node, known as a bootnode, during the initial startup phase, establishing a foundational network link.

### Gateway Nodes

Within this network, providers have the option to configure gateway nodes. These nodes serve as the initial recipients of bid submissions, which are then propagated through the network via a gossip protocol, ensuring widespread distribution among providers.

The subsequent diagram provides a detailed representation of the bid, commitment, and fund flows within the mev-commit framework, showcasing the efficiency and effectiveness of P2P interactions among MEV actors.
