## What is mev-commit?

Mev-commit is a peer-to-peer (P2P) networking platform designed to facilitate direct and real-time interactions and coordination between mev actors and execution providers. It provides a robust network for exchanging execution bids and cryptographic commitments, which are used to specify execution requirements in detail and to receive credible commitments that act as promises to fulfill bid requirements. mev-commit allows actors to engage in "fast games" such as preconfirmations through real-time cryptographic commitments, and settles the result using a high throughput blockchain and an oracle.

## Actors

Network actors' roles are defined based on their interactions with other ecosystem actors. A diagram below depicts a given mev actor's relative placement compared to others.

For example, a Searcher is a bidder for a Sequencer; but that same Sequencer can be a bidder for a block builder. Thus it's best to think of actors' roles in mev-commit similar to their roles in the mev pipeline. To the left of the diagram are bidders, and to the right of the diagram are execution providers who can issue commitments against these bids.

Under PBS, information only moves to the right amongst actors in the mev pipeline. With mev-commit, credible commitments for execution that share bits of information flow from providers back to bidders, who consume blockspace.

### **Providers**

Providers of execution services, such as **Block Builders and Rollup Sequencers**.

### **Bidders**

Users bidding for execution services include **mev searchers, AA bundlers, solvers, Rollup Provers, and others seeking efficient use of block space**. For detailed roles and interactions, refer to the [Actors](https://docs.primev.xyz/concepts/overview/actors) section.

## Bids

Within mev-commit, bids act as the foundational requests placed by bidders, signaling their need for specific transaction execution services. This process occurs within a peer-to-peer networking setup to streamline direct negotiations with execution service providers like block builders and rollup sequencers. Each bid, marked by the unique identifier of a transaction hash, enables a straightforward mechanism for providers across the network to recognize and respond to these requests.&#x20;

Bids essentially convey a user's readiness to pay a certain fee for the execution of their transaction, proposing a price designed to motivate execution providers to give priority to their transaction.&#x20;

## Commitments

Commitments within mev-commit represent the execution providers' affirmative responses to bids, confirming their agreement to execute the specified transactions at the proposed prices within designated blocks. These commitments are conveyed through cryptographic proofs or digital signatures, signifying the providers' acceptance of a bid.

Commitments serve as the critical link that aligns the supply and demand dynamics of the network, facilitating an effective and streamlined process for transaction execution.&#x20;

## Why mev-commit?

**Mev-commit** addresses the centralizing tendencies of mev within Ethereum's ecosystem. Unchecked, mev can lead to consensus instability and the emergence of permissioned communication infrastructures among searchers, block producers, and validators.

In a PoS (Proof of Stake) Ethereum landscape, where block subsidies are expected to reduce, mev's proportion in total staking revenue becomes significantly more impactful. mev-commit offers a decentralized solution, enabling real-time, transparent exchanges between various mev actors. It facilitates a fairer, more accessible mev environment, fostering a more stable, efficient, and equitable blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging mev-commit, actors can engage in mev opportunities while contributing to the overall health and decentralization of Ethereum.
