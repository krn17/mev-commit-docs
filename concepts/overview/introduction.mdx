## What is mev-commit?

Mev-commit is a peer-to-peer (P2P) networking platform designed to facilitate direct and real-time interactions between mev actors and execution providers. It provides a robust network for exchanging execution bids and commitments, thus significantly improving the transaction execution process. This platform allows for detailed specification of execution requirements and delivers timely and reliable commitments, ensuring a more precise and efficient transactional experience.

## Why mev-commit?

**mev-commit** addresses the centralizing tendencies of mev within Ethereum's ecosystem. Unchecked, mev can lead to consensus instability and the emergence of permissioned communication infrastructures among searchers, block producers, and validators.

In a PoS (Proof of Stake) Ethereum landscape, where block subsidies are expected to reduce, mev's proportion in total staking revenue becomes significantly more impactful. mev-commit offers a decentralized solution, enabling real-time, transparent exchanges between various mev actors. It facilitates a fairer, more accessible mev environment, fostering a more stable, efficient, and equitable blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging mev-commit, actors can engage in mev opportunities while contributing to the overall health and decentralization of Ethereum.

## Actors

In the mev-commit ecosystem, participants are divided into Bidders, including mev searchers, AA bundlers, solvers, and Rollup Provers seeking efficient block space utilization, and Providers, such as Block Builders and Rollup Sequencers, who execute transactions. For detailed roles and interactions, refer to the [Actors](./#actors) section.

## Bids

Within mev-commit, bids act as the foundational requests placed by bidders, signaling their need for specific transaction execution services. This process occurs within a peer-to-peer networking setup to streamline direct negotiations with execution service providers like block builders and rollup sequencers. Each bid, marked by the unique identifier of a transaction hash, enables a straightforward mechanism for providers across the network to recognize and respond to these requests.&#x20;

Bids essentially convey a user's readiness to pay a certain fee for the execution of their transaction, proposing a price designed to motivate execution providers to give priority to their transaction.&#x20;

#### Bids and Privacy

mev-commit is inherently pseudonymous, allowing any Ethereum address to submit a bid for the execution of any transaction, including bids for transactions that belong to others. Bids are visible to providers on the network and are identifiable by transaction hashes. Bids get processed by network providers and mev-commit chain validators for verifiable commitments and seamless reward settlement.

## Commitments

Commitments within mev-commit represent the execution providers' affirmative responses to bids, confirming their agreement to execute the specified transactions at the proposed prices within designated blocks. These commitments are conveyed through cryptographic proofs or digital signatures, signifying the providers' acceptance of a bid.

Commitments serve as the critical link that aligns the supply and demand dynamics of the network, facilitating an effective and streamlined process for transaction execution.&#x20;

#### Commitments and Privacy

mev-commit offers standard and privacy-preserving commitment methods for providers to choose from. Privacy-preserving commitments safeguard the confidentiality of commitment details, letting only the bidder know their bid is committed to during the block slot, and revealing the full details for the network after the slot concludes.
