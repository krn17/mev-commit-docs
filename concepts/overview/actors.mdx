### **Actors**

#### **Providers:**
In the mev-commit ecosystem, **Providers** are pivotal in shaping the blockchain landscape. This group includes:

- **Block Builders**: They curate and optimize transaction inclusion in blocks, maximizing the efficiency and value extraction from the Ethereum block space.
- **Rollup Sequencers**: Specializing in layer 2 solutions, they sequence transactions on rollups to enhance scalability and efficiency beyond Ethereum's base layer.

Primev streamlines the bid/commit interactions between these Providers and Bidders, ensuring a seamless execution process that aligns with Ethereum's decentralized ethos.

#### **Bidders**
Bidders compete for optimal transaction execution, utilizing strategies that span from value extraction to efficient block space utilization. This category encompasses:

- **MEV Searchers**: Seekers of maximum extractable value opportunities, leveraging transaction order for profit.
- **Solvers**: Participants who tackle complex computational problems within the blockchain ecosystem, such as those found in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or blockchain-based puzzles. Solvers play a vital role in optimizing transaction ordering and execution, contributing to the overall efficiency and fairness of the blockchain.
- **AA Bundlers** and **Rollup Provers**: Innovators in transaction efficiency, bundling transactions for streamlined execution or proving transactions within rollups, contributing to Ethereum's scalability.

#### **Primev's Role in Facilitating Ecosystem Synergy**
Primev is at the forefront of enhancing interactions within this ecosystem. By providing a robust platform for Providers and Bidders to communicate, Primev addresses the inherent complexities of transaction execution. Its mission is to reduce trust assumptions, promote transparency, and tackle the evolving challenges of decentralization.
