## Understanding Bridging Mechanisms

The mev-commit chain utilizes advanced bridging mechanisms to ensure a secure and efficient transfer of assets between the Ethereum mainnet (L1) and the mev-commit chain. Here's a detailed breakdown of these mechanisms:

### **Hyperlane Warp Route**

- **Implementation**: The mev-commit chain is bridged to Ethereum's Sepolia testnet through a hyperlane warp route, involving various agents who manage and validate cross-chain messages.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: The process begins with a user transaction on the origin chain, triggering events for off-chain agents. Relayers transport these messages to the destination chain, where validators sign attestations to the merkle root of the origin chain. This is vital for ensuring the integrity of cross-chain communications.

### **Native Token Mint/Burn**

- **Custom ERC20 Contract**: A specialized ERC20 contract on the mev-commit chain is responsible for minting and burning native ether, corresponding to the bridging actions. This ensures that the synthetic asset on the mev-commit chain (representing Ethereum or Sepolia ether) accurately reflects the locked collateral on the origin chain.

### **Whitelist Contract**

- **Managing Bridging Permissions**: A whitelist contract manages addresses authorized to mint or burn native ether as part of the bridging process. This contract is crucial for integrating various bridging technologies and maintaining control over who can perform these critical functions.

### **Importance of Origin Chain Security**

- **Selective Bridging**: Only bridges originating from Ethereum L1 should be allowed to mint native ether on the mev-commit chain. This is to prevent the impact of compromised states on other chains affecting the mev-commit chain.

### **Fee Mechanism**

- **Non-inflationary Approach**: The fee mechanism on the mev-commit chain is designed to be non-inflationary, maintaining a strict 1:1 peg between the sidechain ether and the L1 escrowed ether. This is achieved through a variation of EIP-1559, where base fees are accumulated in a treasury and priority fees are allocated to block signers.
