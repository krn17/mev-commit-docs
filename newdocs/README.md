### What is Primev?

**Primev** represents a pioneering development in blockchain communication, focusing on the blockbuilding process and execution bids within Ethereum's ecosystem. As a domain-agnostic network, Primev aims to illuminate and streamline the complex interactions among various actors in the MEV (Miner Extractable Value) pipeline. Primev network aims to solve coordination inefficiencies that continue to arise in blockchain ecosystems as more roles are introduced into systems such as the mev pipeline and more solutions arise for increased decentralization and censorship resistance.

Aligned with the ethos of the crypto community and Ethereum's foundational vision, Primev is not just a tool but a strategic facilitator. It bridges the gap between users' expectations and the blockchain's ability to meet them, enhancing user experience and confidence in blockchain interactions. Primev's approach is about empowering users to communicate their needs clearly and monitor the fulfillment of these needs, ensuring their actions are based on reliable and timely information.

### mev-commit

Our first product, **mev-commit**, a key component of Primev, is a peer-to-peer networking software designed for real-time interaction between various mev actors. It enables the exchange of execution bids and commitments, offering a more granular and dynamic transaction execution experience.
