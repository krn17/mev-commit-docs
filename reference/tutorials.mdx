## Receiving your First Pre-Confirmation

We have a running mev-commit provider node on our testnet that will always return you a Pre-Confirmation.
However, this provider is not a builder, and will not produce blocks.
The node is purely to showcase the process of submitting a bid and waiting for a pre-confirmation from the network.

### Step 1. Get the Bidder Node up and running

```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -o launchmevcommit <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primevprotocol/scripts/main/launchmevcommit> \
&& chmod +x launchmevcommit \
&& ./launchmevcommit --node-type bidder
```

This will fund your wallet, and start a new mev-commit bidder node for you.

If you‚Äôve already run the command, it will ask you if you want to overwrite, for a clean setup, respond with a `y`.

### Step 2. Submit Bid and wait for Pre-Confirmation

Change the `txHash` `amount` and `blockNumber` to your liking

```bash ‚ùØ_ terminal
curl -X POST <http://localhost:13523/v1/bidder/bid> \
-d '{
  "txHash": "91a89B633194c0D86C539A1A5B14DCCacfD47094",
  "amount": 20000,
  "blockNumber": 899099
}'
```

üéâ Congrats, you‚Äôve should receive a Pre-Confirmation!
